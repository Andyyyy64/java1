this code initializes two integer variables x and y to 8 and 5, respectively, and calls a method movePoint(x, y) which assigns new values to x and y. However, since Java passes primitive data types by value, the original values of x and y remain unchanged and the output of the code displays the original values of x and y, which are 8 and 5, respectively.
