Both a[0] and b[0] are "777" because after the line b = a;, both array references a and b point to the same array in memory. When the line a[0] = 777; is executed, it changes the value of the first element in the array that both a and b are pointing to. Since both a and b are now pointing to the same array, when you print the values of a[0] and b[0], both will show "777" as they are referring to the same element in the same array.
